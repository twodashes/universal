# Universal "kitchen sink" utility functions

Like @lodash, but with more dashes (lots of functionality, and uses underscores instead of camelCase). Utilities and "pure" functions (almost pure - sorting use [].sort()). Promises, filtering, sorting, combining, text analysis, math, curry, sleep, etc.

See also: 📙🚀 [twodashes-browser](https://github.com/twodashes/browser) 📙🚀, which is structured the same way, but only for browser-specific code like OS, Retina, AJAX, URLs, etc. Also [twodashes-node](https://github.com/twodashes/node), for HTTP requests and CLI args for Node. Planned for the future are more platform-specific functions: twodashes-rnative" for React Native, twodashes-ionic", and in a galaxy far far away twodashes-quasar".

### ⚠️ PLEASE NOTE: ⚠️

All names in this library (functions, files) will change. Currently figuring out what to call everything. This library will be stabled when released as **`version 1`**. All this is new and NOT well tested. Please let me know if anything is broken.

[![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/twodashes-universal.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/twodashes-universal) ![testing in progress](coverage/badge-statements.svg) Currently in progress: testing, documentation, examples.

### Try it:

Use it instantly in **[CodeSandbox.io](https://codesandbox.io/s/twodashes-universal-demo-2r4os)**

# Installation

### ES Modules - import from "/esm/" to support tree-shaking:

```JavaScript
  import { sort_by_rating_and_position } from "@twodashes/universal/esm/sort_strings"
```

### CommonJS - require from "/umd/" folder:

```JavaScript
  const { sort_by_rating_and_position } = require(twodashes-universal/umd/sort_strings")
```

### Browser script tag use "/umd/" folder

```html
<!-- download all functions into window.__ -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/twodashes-universal@latest/umd/index.js"></script>
<!-- download only the types of functions you need into window.__ - from /umd/category_of_functions -->
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/twodashes-universal@latest/umd/sort_strings.js"></script>
```

**This builds as UMD (Universal Module Definition) in the "/umd/" folder, for both Node.js and the browser.** The original code is built using ES Modules, and is available in "/esm/" folder. It is not minified, but is small, simple, and efficient enough without being transpiled, so feel free to import from "/esm/".

### Twodash contents (documentation pages coming soon):

- coming soon - for now please see "./src" folder which uses standard JsDoc comments

### Other libraries to try (steal functions from):

- [universal-utils](https://github.com/matthiasak/universal-utils#readme) - useful stuff for Node and browser!
- [javascript-algorithms](https://github.com/trekhleb/javascript-algorithms)
- [todash](https://github.com/hannq/todash/tree/master/src) - comments/readme all in Chinese
- [numjs](#) - brings some array/math functionality from Python to JS

# Featured (examples):

### Universal functions:

`str_hash()` to make a unique number out of a long or short string of text. Not for security or cryptography, but helps a lot to make a unique ID.

`syllable_count()` returns number of syllables for a given word

`arr_remove_item()` removes a value from an array, by value

`ends_in_vowel()` returns true if the input word ends in a vowel

`sort_objects_by_property()` just like `sort_by_rating_and_position()`, but instead of taking a list of items and object of ratings as separate parameters, it takes a list of objects, and sorts the list based on a property of each object.

`sleep()` returns a Promise after a number of milliseconds. Use with async/await to mimic other programming languages like Bash

`for_each_promise_all()` returns a Promise - like a [].forEach, executes the function on each value in array - but with Promises

`call_later()` a taste of curry - define the function and arguments seprately, to be called later.

`parse_error_message()` Error messages come in all shapes and sizes. From simple string, to standard `new Error('...')` to Axios/fetch promises containing an error... Returns a string which you can display to your user, without fear.

### For browser only:

`load_script()` loads a script file into your document

`object_from_querystring()` and other URL utils

`is_retina()` true if on MacBook for example, or any other "retina" or higher resolution screen

### For node.js only:

`parse_cli_args()` gets arguments passed to NodeJS process when it was started

### And many more

As I make write (or find on Stackoverflow) a new function for myself/clients/employers, I copy it to this library. Please contribute your own. Let's combine efforts!

See [CodePen example](https://codepen.io/paulshorey/pen/bGweWaB?editors=0012). Play around with all the functions.

# Develop:

Please try it, file an issue, add or fix some code, make a pull request. I'd love to make you an equal contributor. Contact [Paul Shorey](https://paulshorey.com) with any feature requests or bugs. Thank you! Unit tests, code sandbox examples, and better documentation are currently in progress.

This project is built using ES Modules in `./esm/`. It is then compiled into Universal Module Definition (UMD) in `./umd/` which works in Node.js and the browser.
